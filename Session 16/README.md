# Kaggle Titanic: Machine Learning Modeling and Deployment
This repository builds a machine learning model on Titanic dataset, creates a web app with Flask to predict the probability of survival per passenger, and deploys the app to Heroku.

## Quick Look
- This video will help you get a feel for the app.
